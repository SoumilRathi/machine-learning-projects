The dataset used for this project was offered by Microsoft, originally part of a Kaggle challenge. 

This dataset can be downloaded at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765

I had also added an extra folder to this, which included a random image for testing purposes. This random image can be found at:
