This folder is created for storing the code for identifying which number is being shown by the hand. 


This project was ceeated to be applied to real-life. So, this code can be used to identify which number someone is holding up in real-time. 
The project has been split into two different parts - identifying the hand, from the input video stream, 
and then identifying the number of fingers held up by that hand.
